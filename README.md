<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
I am a web developer and UI designer that admires the ingenuity of OBS Studio's team. This theme I created is my contribution to the OBS community. I am looking forward to fine tuning this theme over time. I think my next attempt will be the icons. Hmmm?</p>

<p>Well, I am heading back into my lab. You can reach me on IG @agentbey.travel.</p>

<p>Let me know how the theme is working for you. Love the feedback.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
